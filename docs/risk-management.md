The primary approach used by this program requires setting a stop-loss for each trade and automatically calculates the total position size based on:

1. Your specified risk amount (in USD)
2. The distance between entry and stop-loss prices
3. Bybit's trading fees

With this approach, **leverage does not affect your risk** — your risk is fixed by the stop-loss distance and position size calculation. Leverage only affects the number of concurrent positions — the higher the leverage, the more positions you can open within your available margin.
