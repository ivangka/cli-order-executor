# CLI Order Executor

A console tool for managing perpetual futures orders on Bybit via API.

> **Usage Notes**
> 
> - For all functions of the program to work correctly, set **One-Way Mode** in your Bybit account.
> - The program doesn't use the **Post-Only** option. If you place a limit order at a price worse than the current market price, it will be executed immediately as a market order.
> - Both **USDT** and **USDC** perpetual contracts are supported.
> - When trading USDT‑based pairs, you can omit the “USDT” suffix.  
>   *For example, entering `BTC` will automatically be interpreted as `BTCUSDT`.*

## Full Documentation

## Risk Management

The primary approach used by this program requires setting a stop-loss for each trade and automatically calculates the total position size based on:

1. Your specified risk amount (in USD)
2. The distance between entry and stop-loss prices
3. Bybit's trading fees

With this approach, **leverage does not affect your risk** — your risk is fixed by the stop-loss distance and position size calculation. Leverage only affects the number of concurrent positions — the higher the leverage, the more positions you can open within your available margin.
